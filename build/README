You can compile the programs in this directory
    $ cd build
    $ rm -r C*
    $ cmake ../
    $ make

Then the executable ./exampleB4a   is created.
You can execute the program by

    $ ./exampleB4a

in the GUI mode. You can enter commands to the GUI.   The simplest one is 

     /run/beamOn 100

You can also run the program in batch mode.

  $ ./exampleB4a -m runrun.mac

The output root file is "B4_2MeV.root"  (I am sorry for the strange name).
The output file can be read by p3.C as follows:

  $ root -l
  root [0] .x p3.C

Then you can see the simple histogram and the Hit map.
At present all the root macros "*.C" work somehow.
